# python Bank Customer Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzing bank customer churn data using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in Colab
This project provides an exploratory analysis of a bank's customer churn dataset. The goal is to understand the underlying structure and relationships in the data that may contribute to customer churn.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following key features:
- Customer ID
- Surname
- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender**
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Credit Card Ownership
- Active Membership
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target: 1 = churned, 0 = retained)

## 📌 Objective

To explore the dataset visually and statistically in order to:
- Detect trends and anomalies
- Understand correlations between variables
- Set a foundation for future modeling

## 📈 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Read the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Initial Inspection**:
   - Checked dataset shape, data types, and sample rows.
   - Looked for null values or incorrect types.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Summarized numerical variables.
   - Counted value distributions for categorical variables.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Bar plots for categorical distributions
   - Histograms for continuous features
   - Correlation **heatmap** to identify strongly related variables

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
